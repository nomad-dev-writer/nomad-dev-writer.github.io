We have likes and dislikes. We complain about things just like anyone else. Our opinions can be dumb and naÃ¯ve, but sometimes brilliant. I just wanted to record all these thoughts somewhere, just like my diary, but in a way that I can enjoy â€“ in the form of tasting notes.<p>As it gives a hint, I love eating and cooking. It's something I love to always talk about with others. In the era of YouTube media, I also recently learned how sommeliers evaluate wines and record their thoughts, something I've never done before. So I thought I'd just give it a try.<p>I will (probably) take notes on any topic from <strong>MY</strong> point of view, obviously not everyone will agree with me. Well, I honestly don't care, but I've listed some key points below for you to keep in mind:<ul><li>I stay anonymous, because I want to be <em>dumb in private</em>. (And yes I'm writing dumb notes in public...)<li>I actively use LLMs to help me write, but only for polishing up my writing rather than retrieving information.<li>My tastes will be very, very opinionated. Especially on foods, of course.<li>I will try not to talk about sensitive, political topics unless I feel confident enough that I have relevant knowledge around them.<li>My notes will be frequently updated after being posted, and even deleted depending on my mood.<li>My website design will be frequently updated as I continue posting. If something is broken, yes it is broken, just ignore it. I'll (probably) deal with it one day.</ul><p>Also, below are some of my backgrounds that may help you to understand my points of view:<ul><li>I'm an Asian man. Currently I'm based in East London.<li>Unlike the blog title, I'm no longer a nomad. (sorry!) But I did live in many places.<li>I work in the tech industry.<li>...I guess that's enough info? ðŸ˜…</ul></div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> Â© 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
