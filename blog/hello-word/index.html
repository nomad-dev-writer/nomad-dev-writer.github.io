Every single time, they failed for... well countless number of reasons. One of the main reasons I failed was because obviously I was over-thinking, trying to be <em>perfect</em>... in everything. Starting from the choice of blogging platform and technology, the design, the theme, and also the post itself. Endless considerations. My design and tech background definitely did not help there.<p>Oh well, here I go again, after nth failed attempt to run a blog, ready to face (n+1)th failure. At least this time I have a little more advantage, as there are so many LLMs out there to help me. Plus, I've set some rules to myself this time on how I want to run this blog:<ul><li><strong>Write fast, fix later.</strong> As hinted in the <a href=/about>about</a> page, all the posts will be <em>frequently</em> updated.<li><strong>Broken stuff?</strong> I don't care. I'll stop falling into the rabbit hole of infinitely <em>fixing</em> website. I'm supposed to be <em>posting</em>, not <em>coding</em>.<li><strong>Do I sound stupid?</strong> Just be myself. Nobody is perfect and we all have different opinions and views towards this world. I'll try best to be <em>honest</em>, although I'll still be cautious and think twice on the topic.</ul><p>Let's see how long I'll manage to run this site this time. My first aim is to post five <em>notes</em>, without thinking much.</div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> Â© 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
