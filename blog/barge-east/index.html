I've enjoyed their garden during the summer months, sampling their lighter fare – the wings and fish & chips are particularly noteworthy – and decided it was high time to experience their mothership.<h1 id=newlyn-salt-cod-croquette-silo-s-preserved-lemon-alioli>Newlyn Salt Cod Croquette, Silo's Preserved Lemon Alioli</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/newlyn-salt-cod-croquette-silos-preserved-lemon-alioli.d6f213da9cbf87df.webp><p>This croquette, reminiscent of Bacalhau, possessed a seemingly burnt exterior, which was, in fact, intentional. The accompanying sauce, with its delightful earthy notes, courtesy of <a href=https://www.silolondon.com/>Silo</a>, piqued my curiosity as to its precise origin. The croquette itself boasted a perfectly textured crust, yielding to a soft potato mash, while the pleasantly salty, chewy pieces of cod provided a delightful contrast.<h1 id=charred-cucumber-nasturtium-oil-ajo-blanco-dukka>Charred Cucumber, Nasturtium Oil, Ajo Blanco & Dukka</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/charred-cucumber-nasturtium-oil-ajo-blanco-and-dukka.998259f4a3c70d86.webp><p>The charred cucumber, surprisingly pleasant despite its notable saltiness, left me contemplating ideal pairings. While bread seemed unsuitable, a cracker might have provided the perfect textural contrast. The fresh, grassy aroma of nasturtium permeated each bite, and the cucumber's texture, clearly the result of careful selection, was exceptional.<h1 id=devon-wood-pigeon-sour-cherry-labneh-mole-poblano-bitter-leaf-salad>Devon Wood Pigeon, Sour Cherry Labneh, Mole Poblano, Bitter Leaf Salad</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/devon-wood-pigeon-sour-cherry-labneh-mole-poblano-bitter-leaf-salad.eb3b5955f0ce7da0.webp><p>The pigeon, remarkably devoid of any gamey notes, was exceptionally tender throughout. The legs, boasting a delightful texture, paired beautifully with the accompanying sauce. The sweet and sour cherries provided a vibrant counterpoint. While the composition of the other, refreshingly sour sauce remained a mystery, its presence was undeniably impactful. The pigeon breast, tender and reminiscent of duck, was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The overall flavour of the pigeon meat was subtle and pleasing. Oh, not to forget the perfectly balanced bitterness from the leaves.<h1 id=british-market-fish-over-coals-bouillabaisse-sauce-samphire>British Market Fish Over Coals, Bouillabaisse Sauce, Samphire</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/british-market-fish-over-coals-bouillabaisse-sauce-samphire.7d4d6c8da870cd9b.webp><p>The monkfish tail, expertly cooked and infused with earthy herbs, offered a delightful chewiness. The sauce was truly exceptional, a highlight of the dish. The accompanying mayonnaise-like sauce, though pleasantly soft, was ultimately overshadowed by the robust flavour of the bisque-like bouillabaisse sauce.<h1 id=glazed-aubergine-mushroom-xo-casher-cream-seeds-garden-chard>Glazed Aubergine, Mushroom XO, Casher Cream, Seeds, Garden Chard</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/glazed-aubergine-mushroom-xo-casher-cream-seeds-garden-chard.11829b8fd0618396.webp><p>Due to the small portion size, discerning the precise flavour profile was challenging. However, the dish was undeniably well-balanced, showcasing a delightful interplay of textures between the soft aubergine and the crispy sauce. While the taste and combination of textures were commendable, the portion size was disappointingly meagre.<h1 id=fried-potate-terrine-umami-shallot-herb-dressing>Fried Potate Terrine, Umami, Shallot & Herb Dressing</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/fried-potate-terrine-umami-shallot-and-herb-dressing.dbdd76eec1282a3a.webp><p>The potatoes were exceptionally well-fried, achieving a perfect crispness. The classic pairing with the dill sauce was superb, almost evoking the flavours of a salmon dish.<h1 id=confit-hispi-cabbage-romesco-cabbage-crisps>Confit Hispi Cabbage, Romesco, Cabbage Crisps</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/confit-hispi-cabbage-romesco-cabbage-crisps.2949e229bab5baa4.webp><p>The cabbage possessed an aroma reminiscent of kimchi or sauerkraut, yet its flavour profile was distinctly different. The soft cabbage was beautifully complemented by a tomato-based pesto-like sauce, and the addition of crispy kale chips provided a delightful textural contrast.<h1 id=orange-wine-bedoba-kakheti-georgia>Orange wine, Bedoba, Kakheti, Georgia</h1><img alt="Barge East, London" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/orange-wine-bedoba-kakheti-georgia.d29c80afff51571c.webp><p>The Georgian wine was exceptional, quite possibly the finest I've tasted in recent memory.<h1 id=overall>Overall</h1><p>The food was of a good standard and the overall experience was very enjoyable. The ship's interior evokes a sense of nostalgia, though the air circulation could be improved, as the grilling takes place within the confined space. While the meal was pleasant, the prices felt a touch high. The novelty of dining in a restored vessel is appealing, but I'd have appreciated more insights into the ship's history woven into the menu, and a clearer connection between the garden and the dishes served.</div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> © 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
