The fresh spinach leaves, unfortunately, were too few in number to make any real impact on the flavour profile. Though no sauce accompanied the dish, ketchup, mayonnaise, or brown sauce were readily available upon request.<p>This combination offered a well-balanced and subtle flavour, although I personally craved a bit more of a <em>kick</em>. It seems the restaurant intentionally minimised the additional ingredients to showcase their black pudding, but its inherent mildness prevented it from truly shining. Some might find this dish a tad bland, but its gentle and comforting savour undoubtedly makes it an excellent companion to a good cup of coffee.<h2 id=brown-bread>Brown bread</h2><p>I didn't manage to snap a photo of this simple yet satisfying treat. The classic Irish brown bread, with its subtle sweetness and incredibly soft texture, was wonderful on its own. The addition of a generous pat of butter made it something truly special.<h2 id=coffee>Coffee</h2><p>Interestingly, the beans used at INIS are roasted locally by <a href=https://www.drinkbadcoffee.com/>BAD coffee</a>. From my past experiences with their coffee, their typical dark roast profile isn't quite to my personal taste, as I tend to favour a lighter, more acidic coffee. However, the beans used at INIS seemed to be a medium-dark roast, which paired rather well with the breads.<h2 id=overall>Overall</h2><p>Both the brioche bun and the brown bread were truly enjoyable, showcasing exceptional textures and perfectly toasted surfaces. The meticulous selection of Irish ingredients was evident. While I'm not entirely convinced that the chosen ingredients truly shone as a complete dish, I'd certainly be willing to give INIS another try. Price-wise, it seems to be positioned as a higher-end coffee and brunch spot, so it's not somewhere I could frequent every Saturday morning.</div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> Â© 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
