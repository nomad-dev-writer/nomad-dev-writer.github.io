To be honest, I didn't really expect much in terms of food in this part of France. But, I felt obliged to try their seafood – and of course, compare it to what I'd find in Dover. How would they handle the same ingredients, from the same ocean, but on opposite sides of the Channel?<p>In truth, I'm not entirely sure where their seafood (especially the mussels) came from, though it's likely they were farmed somewhere along the Channel coast. So, let's just call this a bit of fun, a light-hearted comparison between two coastal towns.<h1 id=huitres-normandes-3-normandy-oysters-3>Huîtres Normandes №3 (Normandy oysters №3)</h1><img alt="Huîtres Normandes №3" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/huitres-normandes-no3.de470e77fc85377a.webp><p>There's not much to say about these – oysters are oysters, after all, and the accompanying acidic sauce perfectly served its purpose. The bread provided a welcome respite between oysters, preventing the overpowering flavour of the sea from becoming too much.<p>Interestingly, the number indicates the size of the oyster, with lower numbers denoting larger sizes. №3 falls somewhere between 56-65 grams, but they certainly didn't feel small. Each oyster was just the right size to fill my mouth with its briny flavour. It seems the restaurant sources its oysters from different locations depending on the season and availability, and sizes may vary accordingly. One Google Maps photo showed a menu listing Huîtres d'Oléron F/C №2, for instance.<h1 id=croquettes-de-haddock-mayonnaise-fumee-haddock-croquettes-smoked-mayonnaise>Croquettes de haddock / mayonnaise fumée (Haddock croquettes / smoked mayonnaise)</h1><img alt="Croquettes de haddock / mayonnaise fumée" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/croquettes-de-haddock-mayonnaise-fumee.34b4814bcfd3bc74.webp><p>Ah, this had to be better than anything I could find back in the UK – haddock in fish and chips versus croquettes! Just kidding, that's not a fair comparison, so let's not dwell on it. The croquettes were wonderfully crispy and flavourful, although the taste of the haddock itself was somewhat lost. This isn't surprising, given the naturally subtle flavour of white fish. The accompanying fresh salad helped to balance this, but I must confess, I still have a soft spot for Pastéis de Bacalhau.<h1 id=marmite-de-coquillage-a-la-flamande-flemish-style-shellfish-stew>Marmite de coquillage a la flamande (Flemish-style shellfish stew)</h1><img alt="Marmite de coquillage a la flamande" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/marmite-de-coquillages-a-la-flamande.cf7f3b774c5b982b.webp><p>For our main course, we opted for the mixed shellfish rather than just mussels. The dish arrived laden with mussels, almond clams (amandes), razor clams (couteaux), and regular clams (palourde). The sheer size of the portion was staggering. There was no way the two of us could finish it!<br> To our surprise, diners at neighbouring tables were tackling individual portions of this mammoth stew, a feat that left us quite astonished.<p>The flavour of this so-called "Flemish-style" stew was somewhat familiar. If I'm honest, I couldn't distinguish it from other shellfish stews I've encountered. Perhaps it takes inspiration from Waterzooi, but I wasn't entirely convinced of its Flemish authenticity. Nevertheless, the shellfish were fresh and flavourful, although some were a little on the small side.<p>The accompanying chips were a surprisingly good match for the stew, though personally, I'd have preferred a crusty loaf of bread for dipping.<h1 id=creme-brulee-a-la-vanille>Crème brûlée à la vanille</h1><img alt="Crème brûlée à la vanille" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/creme-brulee-a-la-vanille.d7f135b474d9573d.webp><p>I'm not usually one for desserts, so I don't have a particularly discerning palate when it comes to crème brûlée. However, this one was perfectly pleasant. Not too sweet, not too bland, it provided a satisfyingly balanced finish to our meal. The portion was ideal for sharing between two.<h1 id=wine>Wine</h1><p>One of the undeniable pleasures of dining in France is the access to an excellent selection of wines. We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Pouilly-Fumé Présages 2022 - Clair de Brumes - Famille Saget. This rich yet light sauvignon blanc proved to be an excellent pairing for all the dishes we sampled.<h1 id=overall>Overall</h1><p>It's difficult to go wrong with a coastal seafood restaurant, provided the ingredients are fresh. This establishment certainly delivered on that front. While nothing particularly fancy or groundbreaking, it's a solid and reliable choice for any seafood enthusiast. The generous portions are a definite plus, making it an excellent option for a family meal.</div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> © 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
