We were advised to select between six and seven dishes for two, considering their tapas- and pintxo-inspired portions. Unlike other fine-dining establishments, this restaurant offers the delightful opportunity to curate your own culinary journey.<h2 id=salt-cod-potato-puri-with-yuzu-caviar>Salt cod & potato puri with yuzu & caviar</h2><img alt="Salt cod & potato puri with yuzu & caviar" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/salt-and-cod-potato-puri-with-yuzu-and-caviar.a9b575e07b5523c9.webp><p>While looking at the menu, the term "potato puri" wasn't immediately clear, but the dish itself clarified its meaning upon arrival. The combination of cod tartare and yuzu, complemented by the puri, offered a delightful aroma and texture. Considering the somewhat bland nature of raw cod, this approach makes perfect sense; however, the flavour of the caviar wasn't particularly noticeable. If memory serves, the dish was served at room temperature, leading me to ponder whether a chilled tartare might have elevated the overall freshness.<h2 id=bbq-lamb-tartare-with-pea-mint-wasabi>BBQ lamb tartare with pea, mint & wasabi</h2><img alt="BBQ lamb tartare with pea, mint & wasabi" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/bbq-lamb-tartare-with-pea-mint-and-wasabi.f1da59c92d6f52ca.webp><p>The name "BBQ lamb tartare" certainly intrigued me – BBQ and tartare? I anticipated a blue-rare, chargrilled lamb presented in a tartare-style salad. My guess was mostly accurate, though the lamb was cooked slightly more, approaching a perfect medium-rare. The chargrilled aroma blended beautifully with the fresh mint, creating a refreshingly novel combination. The peas offered a pleasant textural element, while the pea shoots contributed to the salad-like freshness. While I personally would have preferred a more pronounced wasabi flavour, its subtlety is understandable considering not all palates appreciate strong spice.<p>One reason I chose this dish was Yorkshire's renowned lamb. I hoped to experience its full potential, but it was somewhat difficult to discern the lamb's flavour in this particular dish. Perhaps the meat was exceptionally fresh and cooked to perfection, but diced into small pieces, its subtle flavour was overshadowed by the other components. I couldn't help but wonder if using beef would have made any difference in taste.<p>I also questioned whether sacrificing the essence of tartare for smokiness was the right approach. Perhaps incorporating other smoked or chargrilled ingredients alongside raw lamb, served cold to maximise the freshness of the tartare salad, might have been a more effective way to achieve both flavour profiles.<h2 id=sashimi-of-red-sea-bream-with-elderflower-rhubarb-green-peppercorn>Sashimi of red sea bream with elderflower, rhubarb & green peppercorn</h2><img alt="Sashimi of red sea bream with elderflower, rhubarb & green peppercorn" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/sashimi-of-red-sea-bream-with-elderflower-rhubarb-and-green-peppercorn.14636de518e6f7a8.webp><p>Whilst the menu described this dish as sashimi, it was in fact a ceviche. The vibrant, acidic sauce, complemented by a selection of minimal vegetables, was delightfully refreshing, and the overall balance was quite good. However, the red sea bream was undeniably overcured, resulting in a crumbly texture. Sadly, this detracted from the dish and resulted in a somewhat unpleasant experience, leading me to question the freshness of the fish. A real disappointment.<h2 id=bbq-mackerel-summer-turnip-smoked-cods-roe-miso-pesto>BBQ mackerel – summer turnip, smoked cods roe & miso pesto</h2><img alt="BBQ mackerel – summer turnip, smoked cods roe & miso pesto" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/bbq-mackerel-summer-turnip-smoked-cods-roe-and-miso-pesto.a621b64e91117cfb.webp><p>A nicely grilled mackerel is, without a doubt, my favourite dish to order in any restaurant. At first glance, this mackerel appeared to be expertly BBQ'd, holding its shape perfectly with the aid of two skewers. It was nicely seasoned, tender, and with just the right amount of moisture. Whilst I might have preferred a slightly crispier skin, the generous amount of pesto on top almost compensated for this.<p>If I'm honest, I was slightly disappointed by the pesto, as the flavour of basil completely overpowered the miso. I understand the intention to subdue the strong miso flavour for those less familiar with it, but I don't think it was entirely successful. Perhaps a sweetened miso or soy sauce glaze applied to the skin during grilling, followed by a milder basil pesto as a final flourish, might have been a more effective approach.<p>The summer turnip salad was subtle and didn't overpower the delicate flavour of the mackerel. Interestingly, neither my dining companion nor I mentioned the smoked cods roe during our meal. I only rediscovered its presence when reviewing the menu and had to scrutinise my photo to confirm its inclusion as a sauce for the salad. Perhaps we were too preoccupied discussing the miso pesto, or maybe the smoked cods roe simply failed to make an impression.<h2 id=salt-aged-duck-malvani-spice-peach-cashew-lime-vanilla-slaw>Salt aged duck – malvani spice, peach & cashew, lime & vanilla 'slaw'</h2><img alt="Salt aged duck – malvani spice, peach & cashew, lime & vanilla 'slaw'" src=https://nomad-dev-writer.github.io/processed_images/salt-aged-duck-malvani-spice-peach-and-cashew-lime-and-vanilla-slaw.2e289fd0931fe3d9.webp><p>Duck is another personal favourite, and I simply couldn't resist trying this dish alongside the mackerel. The plating was immediately striking, with the vibrant slaw taking centre stage. However, one element in particular intrigued me, which I'll elaborate on later.<p>The duck was cooked to perfection, achieving a tender medium-rare with crispy, satisfyingly chewy skin. The subtle hint of Malvani masala sprinkled over the skin added a pleasant touch. Surprisingly, similar to the lamb tartare, the duck didn't have a particularly strong flavour, but in this instance, it served to emphasise the freshness of the meat.<p>The sweetness of the chargrilled peach paired beautifully with the duck, while the cashew nuts provided a welcome textural element. Accompanied by the slaw and mustard, the dish was exceptionally well- balanced. Although the combination of flavours might seem familiar, the execution was flawless.<p>However, one element puzzled me: the temperature of the plate. Undoubtedly a warm dish, it was nonetheless served on a cool plate. Perhaps the chefs intended this to complement the fresh elements like the slaw and peach, but it felt like an oversight. I believe a warm plate would have significantly enhanced the overall experience.<h2 id=overall>Overall</h2><p>Perhaps I was a tad too harsh? Was I expecting too much from a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant? Their pricing certainly points towards a more casual dining experience, but the elegant presentation of the dishes hinted at something more refined. However, compared to other fine-dining establishments, the cooking didn't quite meet my expectations.<p>While I admire their adventurous spirit in incorporating multicultural influences, the elements didn't always come together seamlessly. Even with the British-inspired dishes, the execution was sometimes a little lacking, with details like the serving temperature leaving me unconvinced.<p>Perhaps my personal preferences are simply different. However, I remain optimistic and hope to have a more enjoyable experience should I return to Skosh in the future.</div></article></div><footer class=footer><small> © 2024 </small><small> 0.0.1 </small></footer>
